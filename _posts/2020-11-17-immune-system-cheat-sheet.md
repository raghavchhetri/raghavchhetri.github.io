Our immune system can be broadly categorized into a fast-responding system and a slow-responding system:

**1. Innate or natural system (fast)**

Fast acting system (0-96 hours) which serves as the first-line of defense
* Recongnizes invading substance (**antigens**) which can be pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, or smaller proteins fragments that the pathogens express

* Releases chemical cues (**cytokines**) to alarm and activate the Adaptive response

    
**2. Adaptive system (slow)**

Activated by the alarm bell sounded by the Innate system

It mounts a response by producing **B-cells** and **T-cells**, which is a slow process (can take anywhere from >96 hours to a few days/week)

2.1 B-cells

* Recognize the antigens and produce antibodies to fend off the infection

* Once infection is cleared, the production of antibodies is slowed down and the B-cells convert from antibody-producing plasma B-cells to memory B-cells that persist in our body for years

* When a future infection is detected, they quickly convert to plasma B-cells and mount a faster and stronger immune response
    
2.2 T-cells

* There are two kinds of T-cells: **helper T-cells** and **killer T-cells**

* Helper T-cells release more cytokines (ie sounds the alarm bells) to prime the maturation of B-cells

* Killer T-cells directly kill the infected or hijacked cells

* Remain in the body as memory T-cells once infection is cleared. These memory lymphocytes remain dormant until same pathogen or protein fragments are encountered again

Our immune system can be broadly categorized into a fast-responding system and a slow-responding system as follows:

### **1. Innate or natural system (fast)**
- Fast acting system which serves as the first-line of defense

1.1 Releases chemical cues (**cytokines**) to activate the Adaptive response
  
1.2 Degraded fragments of infectious agent (**antigens**)
    
### **2. Adaptive system (slow)**
- Response begins once alarmed by the Innate system
- Starts producing **B-cells** and **T-cells**; takes a few days

2.1 **B-cells**
- Recognize the **antigens** (fragments of the infecting agent) and produce antibodies to fend off the infection
- Once infection is cleared, the production of antibodies is slowed down and the B-cells convert from antibody-producing **plasma B-cells** to **memory B-cells** that persist in our body for years
- When a future infection is detected, they quickly convert to **plasma B-cells** and mount a faster and stronger immune response
    
2.2 **T-cells**
- There are two varieties of T-cells: **helper T-cells** and **killer T-cells**
- The **helper T-cells** release more cytokines (sounds the alarm bells) to prime the maturation of **B-cells**
- The **killer T-cells** directly kill the infected cells in our body
- Remain in the body as **memory T-cells** once infection is cleared. These memory lymphocytes remain dormant until the next time the same pathogen is encountered

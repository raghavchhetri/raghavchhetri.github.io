Thanks to GitHub Pages, my personal page is now live!
I'll be using [Markdown](//https://www.markdownguide.org/) to author my Scattered dimes posts. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) then rebuilds the pages from the Markdown files. Sounds easy and exciting!

## NTS
1. You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/raghavchhetri/raghavchhetri.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

2. Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

3. This site was created using this [beginner's guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/raghavchhetri/raghavchhetri.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

This static GitHub Page is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and I'm using [Markdown](//https://www.markdownguide.org/) to author my posts.
These tools make the process quite a breeze!

## NTS

1. You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/raghavchhetri/raghavchhetri.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

2. Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

3. This site was created using this [beginner's guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
### Markdown

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/raghavchhetri/raghavchhetri.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

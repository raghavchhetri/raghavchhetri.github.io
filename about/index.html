			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I'm Raghav Chhetri. I'm a research scientist in the <a href="https://www.janelia.org/lab/keller-lab">Keller lab</a> at <a href="https://www.janelia.org/">HHMI Janelia Research Campus</a> in Ashburn, VA. 
				I design optical imaging systems to study 1. the development of early embryos, and 2. the emergence of their early nervous systems.</p>
			
			<p>Before joining Janelia, I was a PhD student in the ,a href="https://users.physics.unc.edu/~aold/">Coherence Imaging Laboratory</a> in the <a href="https://physics.unc.edu/">Department of Physics at UNC Chapel Hill</a>. While there, I designed and built various OCT 
				(Optical Coherence Tomography) based bio-imaging systems to study 1> dynamic light scattering from plasmonic nanoparticles in complex media and extracellular matrix mimics, 
				2> the viscoelasticity of complex fluids, and 3> the elasticity of excised tissue using superparamagnetic nanoparticles as force transducers.

			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I'm interested in designing optical microscopy tools that allow minimally-invasive inspection of live biological samples. In the Keller lab, 
      I am involved in the design and refinement of light-sheet microscopy methods to study embryonic development and nervous system development at a 
      high spatio-temporal resolution.

      ## Biography
      I joined the Keller lab at HHMI Janelia Research Campus in 2013 after completing my PhD in Physics from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill under the 
      supervision of Dr. Amy Oldenburg. I completed my Bachelors in Physics and Mathematics from Truman State University in 2006. During my time as an undergraduate 
      student at Truman, I started tinkering with optics in Dr. Michael Goggin's lab and fell in love with experimental methods, engineering techniques, and optical 
      designs. Fortunately, this fascination has stayed with me until now and keeps me excited about exploring it further.

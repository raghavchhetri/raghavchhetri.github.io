			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>I'm Raghav Chhetri. I'm currently a research scientist in the <a href="https://www.janelia.org/lab/keller-lab">Keller lab</a> at <a href="https://www.janelia.org/">HHMI Janelia Research Campus</a> in Ashburn, VA, and 
				I specialize in designing optical imaging systems to image:
				<p style="color:green;font-size:21px;"> 1. the development of early embryos
				<br> 2. the neural activities in embryos and larvae </p>
			
			<p>Before joining Janelia, I was a Physics PhD student in the <a href="https://users.physics.unc.edu/~aold/">Coherence Imaging Laboratory</a> in the 
				<a href="https://physics.unc.edu/">Department of Physics and Astronomy</a> at <a href="https://www.unc.edu/"> UNC Chapel Hill</a>. While there, I designed and built various OCT 
				(Optical Coherence Tomography) based bio-imaging systems to study:
				<p style="color:green;font-size:21px;"> 1. light scattering from plasmonic nanoparticles in complex fluids and extracellular matrix mimics
				<br> 2. elasticity of excised tissue using superparamagnetic nanoparticles as force transducers
				<br> 3. viscoelasticity of complex fluids and extracellular matrix mimics </p>

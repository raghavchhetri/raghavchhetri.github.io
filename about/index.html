			<p>I'm Raghav Chhetri. As of mid-October, 2022, I am leading an effort to realize a new neuroimaging-focused center at <a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu//">Rockefeller University</a> in New York City. 
				In my new role, I hope to:
				<p style="color:#66CCFF;font-size:23px;"> 1. develop, refine, and disseminate various neuroimaging technologies  
				<br> 2. collaborate, support a wide range of neurobiological inquiries pursued by the Rockefeller scientific community </p>
			
			<p>Previously, I was a Senior Scientist in Philipp Keller's lab at <a href="https://www.janelia.org/">HHMI Janelia Research Campus</a> in Ashburn, VA, where I specialized in designing 
				custom optical imaging systems to:
				<p style="color:#66CCFF;font-size:23px;"> 1. study the development of early embryos at high spatio-temporal resolution
				<br> 2. follow high-speed neuronal activities across the whole-brain of semi-transparent embryos and larvae
					
			<p> Prior to joining Janelia, I was a PhD student in Physics in the <a href="https://users.physics.unc.edu/~aold/">Coherence Imaging Laboratory</a>, 
				<a href="https://physics.unc.edu/">Department of Physics and Astronomy</a> at <a href="https://www.unc.edu/"> UNC Chapel Hill</a>. While there, I designed and built various OCT 
				(Optical Coherence Tomography) based bio-imaging systems to study:
				<p style="color:#66CCFF;font-size:23px;"> 1. light scattering from plasmonic nanoparticles in complex fluids and extracellular matrix mimics
				<br> 2. elasticity of excised tissue using superparamagnetic nanoparticles as force transducers
				<br> 3. viscoelasticity of complex fluids and extracellular matrix mimics </p>

	<h2>Raghav Chhetri</h2>
	<h3>Research Scientist, HHMI Janelia</h3>
	<p> When not surfing the world around us through the eyes of Google, my sights are set on Imaging, Optics, and Microscopy 
		while my ears are busy listening to various Podcasts.				
		This beautiful combination makes me tick and lets me to chase everything that I find interesting.
		Don't take my word for it, <a href="/about">read more about my work...</a></p>
